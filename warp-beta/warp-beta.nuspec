    <description>Cloudflare WARP client

The Cloudflare WARP client allows individuals and organizations to have a faster, more secure, and more private experience online. The WARP client sits between your device and the Internet, and has several connection modes to better suit different needs.
Cloudflare WARP is in part powered by 1.1.1.1, the worldâ€™s fastest DNS resolver.
When visiting sites or going to a new location on the Internet, you should see fast DNS lookups.
WARP, however, is built to trade some throughput for enhanced privacy, by encrypting all traffic both to and from your device.</description>
